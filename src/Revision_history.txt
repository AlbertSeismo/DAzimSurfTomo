Revision History

2016-12:
V1.0 version, using Mineos to do calculation of depth sensitivity kernel.

2017-04:
Iteration version.
Failed to use regionalization for non-positive definite G matrix.

2017-04-23:
Staggered iteration version.

2017-05:
Add Tikhonov regularization.

2017-07-05:
Debug: error in rpathsAzim.f90
(should start from the simplest Synthetic test)


2019-05-30:
V2.0
Use tregn96.f modified from cps to calculate depth sensitivity kernel. (Simplify the whole work flow greatly)

Potential problem: cannot use -fopenmp for depthkernelTI.f90 (but the time cost is affordable)


2019-06-03:
Improve iso-inversion part. Unknown small difference in 6-th iso-inversion, which may be related to gfortran version (works on gcc version 4.8.5 summit/marine, not on gcc version 6.3.0)


2019-06-04:
Modify the inversion into joint inversion for both isotropic part and anisotropic part simultaneously.
